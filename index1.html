		<p>Ultimate Frizbee is a sport that I never played myself,but it's popularity is something hard to ignore in many Midwestern college towns. Students(and people who wish they were still students)spend the few briefs months of good weather,sprinting down field,hurling frizbees,and yelling "stack!!".</p>
		<p>What I find much more entertaining is the large number of people who continue to play when the weather gets windy and the night sky darknes around oh....4:15pm.The sight of frizbees booneranging in the wind is topped only by the knowledge that even when you can't seem,those same plastic discs of death are probably hurtling thrpogh the dark night sky at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening. </p>
		<p>Ultimate Frizbee requires a great deal of stamina and dexterity.Not surprisingly,the IOC offially recognized Ultimate as a sport in 2015. It can go up against other sports for inclusion in Olymic games.</p>
